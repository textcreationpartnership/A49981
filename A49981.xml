            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as I have from my Youth been trained up in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Diſcipline, ſo it has been the goodneſs of God to me to incline my Mind to ſeek after him, and that with a Deſire after Knowledge, leſt my Zeal ſhould only proceed from Ignorance.</p>

                  <hi>Reader,</hi> I do here honeſtly declare, that I would have cited more Contradictions about the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, if I could readily have found them; but indeed, their Books do generally agree in this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> in denying the Reſurrection of the Body that dyeth (as <hi>G. K.</hi> has largely made appear in his late Narrative of the Proceedings at Turners-Hall, <hi>London</hi>) ſo that I found no Paſſages to the contrary. But had it been my buſineſs here to have anſwered Books, I would have ſhewed how miſerably blind <hi>Caleb Puſey</hi> ſhews himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about the Reſurrection in his book, called, <hi>A Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Account,</hi> pray read from pag. 31, to p. 38. and ſee how he endeavours to ſhew G.

P. does not ſay in all his Book, that it is ſufficient for Salvation <hi>without any thing elſe.</hi> Therefore how hypocritical is this to accuſe a man for an Error, and yet dares not aſſert the contrary; but I refer the Reader to G. K<hi>'s</hi> anſwer to ſaid <hi>C. Puſey,</hi> for further ſatisfaction, and ſo proceed to the next Chapter.</p>

            <p>Now therefore ſince W.

               <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was not Chriſt, but a prepared Body; and that the <hi>Jews</hi> did not ſee Chriſt, but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Body; and that the outward Perſon born of the Virgin was no part of Chriſt, but only a Garment (ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> 38, 48.) And to ſtrengthen this Anti-ſcriptural Doctrine, <hi>T.

            <p>Obſerve here how this wiſe Man confounds himſelf: The Scriptures, by his account, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Uncertain, and ſuſpicious (at leaſt) of being corrupted; and yet there is an agreement and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the moſt weighty Reaſons T.

When alas for them! we who have taken their own Advice before, <hi>Not to be ſo dotiſh and blockiſh,</hi> but have learnt to be more knowing, we know it to be not an opening of <hi>Thomas Muſgrove,</hi> but a piece of an old Creed made at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the year 1585. [Thus while they are crying out againſt <hi>Creeds</hi> in others, they patch up Creeds to themſelves.] And fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their Advice before, we have alſo learned to know, that if another Miniſter had preached the ſame things to the ſame People, tho' a Perſon of as good a Life, and more ſound in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Faith of Chriſt, yet wanting either the Unity of the Church, or that faculty of gift of a fluent and affecting delivery of his words, would not raiſe that Life in the People at all.</p>

                  </gap> Penn</hi> plainly tells us, <hi>That the conſequence of Peoples not doubting their Ministers, and not putting them upon the Proof of what they preached, has been the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of much falſe Doctrine, Superstition and Formality.</hi> Here's the ground, it ſeems, of thoſe falſe and confuſed Doctrines before cited, by reaſon of our being too long before we doubted our Miniſters.

            <p>But notwithſtanding, though the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſuch an Adulterous Generation, and had ſo many Miracles wrought before them, yet Jeſus Chriſt promiſed them one Sign more, and that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs was the greateſt Sign of all.

I will make you knew, that I the Light am the true Eternal God,</hi> p. 11. <hi>Light and Life, &amp;c.</hi> Again, <hi>News out of the North,</hi> p. 15. <hi>I am the ſame Door that ever was</hi> (ſays G.

To be ſhort, I omit much more ſuch Doctrine from divers others.</p>
            <p>Now I ſay, ſeeing you have hither to juſtified this as Goſpel, and Chriſtian Doctrine in thoſe who publiſht it, why do you not continue to preach it, as they did, ſeeing alſo 'tis the Faith or Belief of all you Preachers in general, That when you preach or pray, 'tis not you, but Chriſt in you that prays I prove this to be your Belief by theſe two Reaſons,</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> You do never in your Meetings pray
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:31784:77"/>for Pardon or Forgiveneſs of Sin (Not that I have heard in Twenty years due attendance) for ſeeing 'tis Chriſt in you that prays, there is no need of it, he being without ſin.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> You do not pray to Chriſt, becauſe it being Chriſt in you that prays, it is abſurd for Chriſt to pray to himſelf.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But I'll take leave to tell you, <hi>(and prove it too, if need be)</hi> That you are of a different Faith in theſe two things from the Apoſtles, Saints and Martyrs, yea, your Faith or Principle herein is contrary to all the primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in general; for the Scriptures, Church Hiſtory and Book of Martyrs ſhew, that their Religion led them to pray publickly for Pardon for their Sins, and ſome even at the point of Death; and alſo both Apoſtles and other Chriſtians frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayed to Jeſus Chriſt, as well as to God the Father.</p>
            <p>Indeed your Preſumption in this Anti-chriſtian Principle is to be lamented, for when ſome of your Fellow Miniſters have been guilty of <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Adulteries, &amp;c.</hi> though not then openly known, yet theſe men, thus ſecretly guilty, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtoop, no more than you, to pray for Pardon for their Sins, but ſtill keep to their common Form in Prayer; and this is a Truth known to more than your ſelves. Now I ask you, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do you Believe 'tis Chriſt that prays in theſe men too, as well as in you, who may not ſo be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31784:78"/>guilty? Pray anſwer in Truth and Sincerity to this and the reſt of the particulars, or other ways e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſilent; but I have cauſe to believe you will do neither, but rather, as G. W. has of late years done, in anſwering Books, as I have ſeen, where he has not taken notice of ſcarce a twentith part of a Book, but only ſend out ſomething, and call it an Anſwer, to Pleaſe your People, and that they may have ſomething to ſay, when people cry, where is the Anſwer to ſuch or ſuch a Book?</p>
            <p>Now I ſincerely profeſs, that I have done nothing herein but with an honeſt deſign, not having wilfully or knowingly wronged either Books or Authors, in any one paſſage; Therefore I propoſe this to you Preachers, who publickly accuſe us that have lately printed) calling us, <hi>Apoſtates, Lyars,</hi> and that we have both abuſed you and your Friends Books (in falſly citing P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Come <hi>S. Jenings,</hi> Come <hi>John Simcock,</hi> Come <hi>John Rodman, Juda. Allen, W. Gabitas,</hi> and all other our Accuſers, appoint a publick Meeting at

               </gap>lainly, I know you ſo well that I expect no ſuch fair dealing at your hands.</p>
            <p>Therefore I'll give the world a Sign, by which they may know that you do not only abuſe, bely and Charge us falſly in this caſe, But alſo, that your own Conſciences tells you that you are guilty of ſo doing. The Sign is this; If you know and are conſcious to your ſelves that you have and do ſo bely us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then you'll not come forth, according to this Propoſition; But if you find you can get the leaſt advantage of us, by out witting or otherways wording the matter (tho' with never ſo much falſity) Then you'll come forth, and be glad I give you this opportunity. And by this SIGN ſhall you be Proved. Thus my Conſcience bears witneſs, that I am clear of the guilt of your charge, Therefore (as ſays W.

And for thy labour and pains therein, I pray God of his Bounty to reward thee, and alſo protect thee from the cruel Effects of the Envy of thoſe People therein concerned, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Potent round about thee, thou canſt expect no other Protection. Though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the thoughts of the ſuddain ſtop that the <hi>Philadelphia Quakers</hi> met with, when thèy were ſo hot at perſecuting G. K. and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:31784:79"/>his Friends, may in ſome degree check them, and hinder them from doing what otherwiſe they would. Since I was with thee at <hi>Burlingion</hi> in 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>2. I have thought God Almighty was then fitting <hi>thee for</hi> ſome purpoſe, becauſe of the ſuddain and Miraculous Recovery, in great part, of thy Speech, from that extream <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpediment of Stammering, which thou had when I was with thee two years before; and I remember I heard thee then ſay, thou hadſt it from a Child: I call it Miraculous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have known many to have ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, but never before did I know any to looſe it, and Recover their Speech again.</p>
            <p>The currant of great part of thy Book excellently confirms my Obſervation of the <hi>Quakers, viz.</hi> That their Religion really conſiſts in a croſs Method to all other Societies of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that ever were in being; For ſuch things as are indeed Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> they account Nicities, Circumſtantials &amp; Smaller matters, and care not how confuſedly they preach them. But what are really Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:31784:80"/>or ſmaller matters, as Tythe, Mint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (and not of neceſſity for a Chriſtians practice) they make the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of their Religion. And yet, as thou haſt noted, they are Hypocritical in the practice of moſt of thoſe things too, as might alſo be inſtanced in divers other things; I will name two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They make it matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience not to ſing <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, and yet they uſe another way of ſinging in their Meetings; and make a great noiſe with it too, eſpecially when any fluent or thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Preacher comes amongſt them; yea, many of them have written in Poſie or Rhymes, which is to be ſung; and as I remember <hi>W. Baily</hi> and <hi>J Coal</hi> call ſome Rhimes that they have written by the Name of <hi>Songs,</hi> ſo that it ſeems People may ſing the <hi>Quakers</hi> Writings, but not <hi>David's,</hi> by their allowance.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly,</hi> They pretend Conſcience not to Honour or Reſpect their Superiours, by putting off the Hat, but they will bow the Body, and pray what's the difference? I take bowing the Body to be a greater
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:31784:80"/>Reſpect than doffing the Hat. But though they cannot doff the Hat to others, yet thoſe <hi>Quakers</hi> who are wealthy that live in great Towns and Cities in <hi>England,</hi> love Hat Honour ſo well, that they cauſe their Apprentices to doff their Hats and ſtand beat headed before them; this their Conſcience will allow.</p>
            <p>Again, as to <hi>Fighting,</hi> thou has well noted their Hypocriſie and wheeling and turning about both in their Writings, and alſo in their Actions about <hi>Delaware</hi> River. But I wonder how thou came to neglect that notable Inſtance of my old Friend and Acquaintance <hi>Walter Clark,</hi> an antient Preacher, now Governour of <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> who has given ſeveral Commiſſions to Maſters of Veſſels and Privateers to fight the <hi>French, &amp;c.</hi> to defend which and his Commiſſionating the Officers of the Train-bands under his Government, (and ſometimes heading the ſaid Train-bands himſelf on his lofty prancing Horſe, and Souldier-like, cauſed the Inhabitants to ſign the Aſſociation on the head of the Drum) brings this Scripture for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,

            </p>
            <p>Thus by little and little, Inch by Inch they come round, and can do that which at another time is againſt their tender Conſciences; yet I queſtion whether ever they'll be able to wreſtle down the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Governours with only little Guns, till they get great ones; as ſome of them do already maintain in Ships, notwith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>My Friend,</hi> I perceive thee not willing to enlarge, elſe I could have aſſiſted thee with many things out of Books, which I ſuppoſe never came to thy ſight, and eſpecially out of the Books of <hi>G Fox,</hi> who was the firſt ſetter up of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as W. P. declares in his Preface to G. F<hi>'s</hi> Journal; But methinks the world
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:31784:81"/>cannot but ſee <hi>W. P.</hi> turned <hi>Painter</hi> in that Preface; for he there declares the outward Vocation of <hi>G.

            <p>But as for <hi>G. Fox</hi> Books, I dare engage, the <hi>Quakers</hi> will never print a Collection of them; for there ſuch a meſs of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
